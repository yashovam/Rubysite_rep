                    Welcome to our exclusive store. We have a unique product,
                    real natural gems mined over forty years ago, Never burned
                    to enhance color, as mining operations do today. These Gems
                    are absolutely, unadulterated, pure, extremely rare Rubies.
                    They are from the private collection of an Italian
                    diamantaire, a Monsieur Benefico. Therefore, proudly in
                    memory of our father, who used to bow and kiss the hands of
                    ladies from Milan to Montecarlo, Sotheby to Christies...
                    just to value the gemstones on their fingers. But being an
                    extremely distinguished Gentleman and quite good looking,
                    said ladies could not distinguish his love of Gems from
                    their own charms. Please enjoy our wide range of colors and
                    natural inclusions.

                    Rubies are commonly found in 1 carat sizes. Stones that
                    weigh over 2 carats are considerably rarer and are prized
                    much higher than sapphires of equal size. Rubies of over 3
                    carats, such as this exceptional specimen in our store are
                    extremely rare. These are considered far rarer than diamonds
                    of the same weight
